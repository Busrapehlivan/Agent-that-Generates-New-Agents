# System Architecture

## Overview

The Dynamic Agent Generator System is built on a modular architecture that enables flexible creation and management of specialized AI agents. This document outlines the core components and their interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Manager (`agent_manager.py`)

The Agent Manager serves as the central coordinator for all agent-related operations. It:
- Manages agent lifecycle (creation, tracking, removal)
- Coordinates task execution
- Maintains agent state and relationships

Key features:
```python
manager = AgentManager()
agent = manager.create_agent("research", {"topic": "AI"})
result = manager.execute_agent_task(agent_id, input_data)
```

### 2. Agent Factory (`agent_factory.py`)

Implements the Factory pattern for dynamic agent creation:
- Creates specialized agents based on type
- Ensures consistent agent initialization
- Manages agent configuration

Usage:
```python
factory = AgentFactory()
agent = factory.create_agent("research", parameters)
```

### 3. Base Agent (`agents/base_agent.py`)

Abstract base class defining the common interface for all agents:
- Task execution interface
- Context management
- OpenAI API integration

### 4. Specialized Agents

#### Research Agent (`agents/research_agent.py`)
- Focuses on information gathering
- Processes research queries
- Returns structured findings

#### Writing Agent (`agents/writing_agent.py`)
- Generates content in specified styles
- Processes input data into written content
- Maintains consistent writing voice

#### Analysis Agent (`agents/analysis_agent.py`)
- Analyzes input data
- Generates insights
- Provides structured analysis reports

### 5. Utilities (`utils.py`)

Provides common functionality:
- OpenAI API integration
- Context management
- Prompt generation
- Environment configuration

## Data Flow

1. User Request → Agent Manager
2. Agent Manager → Agent Factory
3. Agent Factory → Specialized Agent
4. Specialized Agent → OpenAI API
5. OpenAI API → Specialized Agent
6. Specialized Agent → Agent Manager
7. Agent Manager → User

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API access
- Environment configuration
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)
